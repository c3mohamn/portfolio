      <h5 class="nm-header-1">Summary</h5>
      <p>
        I am a graduate from the University of Toronto where I studied Computer Science. My interests primarily lie in
        web
        technologies but I enjoy anything that involves problem-solving and creating cool apps. I have both work and
        personal experience building projects from the ground up. Anything new I learn turns into a feature or update. I
        have a lot of experience being part of a team, in sports, school, and work. I know what it means to put the
        team's interest ahead of your own as both a leader and a follower.
