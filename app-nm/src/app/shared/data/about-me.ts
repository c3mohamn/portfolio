  background: `
  I am an Afghan Canadian. My parents are both from Afghanistan while I was born in Pakistan where my father worked
    in the UN. I came to Canada when I was five years old, and have been living in the GTA ever since. I have gone
    from Scarborough to Toronto and now Brampton. Maybe Kitchener is next.`,
  school: `I went to University of Toronto, downtown campus, for Computer Science. The first four years of university did not go so well.
  I had lost most of my highschool friends and moved from Toronto to Brampton which turned my commute from 30
  minutes to two hours. So obviously I skipped a lot of class and was very behind in credits. Fortunately, UofT has a
  program called Personal Experience Year (PEY). It's an 12-16 month internship program for Engineering and Computer Science
  students. After applying to dozens of jobs, I finally landed a position with a company called Reportin. After 14 months
  working there, I had a sense of direction and motivation. I went back to school, completed all my credits and graduated
  in June of 2019.`,

    After finishing highschool at East York C.I. in Toronto, I decided to come back for a year (aka victory lap). I
    was not quite
    sure what I wanted to do moving forward. Half way through my victory lap I got an acceptance letter for University
    of Toronto in Computer Science. I foolishly accepted it without knowing how UofTears likes to torture their
    students.
    <br><br>
    After four years, things were not going so well. I was extremely behind in credits, my GPA was terrible, and my
    self esteem was in the gutters. Not to mention I lost had lost all my close friends from highschool and moved from
    Toronto to Brampton which turned my commute from 30 minutes to two hours. So obviously I skipped a lot of class.
    There just no motivation in doing let alone doing well.
    <br><br>
    The best decision I ever made was applying for a program called Personal Experience Year (PEY). It's an internship
    program for Engineering and Computer Science students at UofT. Although, I was very hesitant because my GPA was so
    low. I figured recruitors would just filter me out from the start - and most did. I applied for dozens of jobs,
    and got only three
    interviews. I royally screwed up my first, did okay in the second (okay in interviews is generally a no), and
    finally got an interview with a startup company called Reportin. Unlike the other companies, they did not ask me
    to solve problems in the interview. They gave me a coding assignment to complete prior, then discussed the
    decisions I made and skills I used to complete it. They later told me I was not very good at selling myself, but
    my work spoke for me.
    <br><br>
    After doing my internship for a year, I came back to university with more motivation. I finally had a sense of
    direction of what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be. I had to complete 5.5 credits (regular course load is
    5), three of which had to be 400 level courses (requirement for a specialist). After a lot of sleepless nights and
    actually attending lectures, I completed all my credits with marks that better represented my capabilities.

  work: `Over the years I have worked in a fast food restaurant, call center, as a server, busboy, labourer, and once even
  modelled for an artist who had me hold fake bones (I think) while shirtless and looking deeply into the skull's eyeless
  eyes as if it were a loved one.<br><br>
  My most rewarding experience was my internship as a Junior Software Developer at a startup company called Reportin (now
    called Source). There I learned a vast amount of technical skills and had opportunities to lead
    and take ownership of different projects. My co-workers were extremely smart and taught me the importance of communication between
    clients, teams, and peers. I was offered a part time position during my last year at University, but chose
    to focus on finishing my credits. Now, I want to see what else is out there.`,
  work_long: `
   My first job was at a fast food restaurant called Mr. Tasty's near Victoria Park and Danforth. My older brother had
   worked there before me so the owners expected me to be great, like he was. I was not. I still remember the time I forgot
   to put the actual burger meat inside a burger before giving it to a lady. I had to run after her outside and
   explain how her burger was missing the main ingredient.

   Finally, I got a job in my field. A job that was not just a job, but the start to my career. It was my internship
   with the startup company called Reportin (now called Source).

  interests: `I am a very competitive person at times, which is why I have always liked playing sports and video games. I have played
  on the school basketball and volleyball teams from elementary to highschool. As a kid I was out so much in the sun my legs looked
  like a rainbow from the tan marks my different-length socks gave me. At home we had a Nintendo 64, then a Gamecube. I have fond memories
  playing Need for Speed, Mario Kart, Super Mario 64 and Super Smash Bros. On the computer I played Warcraft III, Dota then
  World of Warcraft (which I still play sometimes).
  <br><br>
  Other than games and sports, I have always loved nature, space and fantasy. I would watch a lot of documentaries with my older
  siblings about black holes, animals, and plants. During university I took several electives in Greek history, mythology and
  terminology. I also enjoy reading fantasy by authors such as GRRM, Tolkien, and Stephen King.
  <br><br>
  In regards to my field, my interests lie in designing and creating cool things. I enjoy figuring out how I will make a new app,
  what it will look like, then actually making it. I enjoyed working on this website, and hopefully it is more complete by the time
  you read this.`
