      After finishing my undergraduate degree and beginning my job hunt, I came to the realization
      that like artists, web developers can also have portfolios.
      <br /><br />
      I figured I should start building my own portfolio, adding on to it as I developed more skills and experiences.
      It could be a place for me to easily showcase who I am and what I apsire to be. A place where
      I could keep a log of everything I learn. Hopefully it captures, to some extent, who I am and
      what I have to offer.
