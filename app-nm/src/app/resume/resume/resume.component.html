    <div class="cell small-8 medium-10">
      I am a graduate from the University of Toronto where I studied Computer Science. My interests primarily lie in web
      technologies but I enjoy anything that involves problem-solving and creating cool apps. I have both work and
      personal experience building projects from the ground up. Anything new I learn turns into a feature or update. I
      have a lot of experience being part of a team, in sports, school, and work. I know what it means to put the team's
      interest ahead of your own as both a leader and a follower.
